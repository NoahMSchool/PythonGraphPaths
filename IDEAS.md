# Game Ideas

## Planet Graph
* How do I generate it?
* Should I have an edge between all planets?
* Default Weight is Distance with multipliers due to terrain or other factors
* Add zones with higher movement cost (use math to figure out if line intersects path)

## Resources
* Different Planets have different resource contents
* Resources include food, fuel, material
  
## Upgrades
* can upgrade fuel tanks to tra
*can upgrade technologies which could unlock new path finding or sorting algorithms
